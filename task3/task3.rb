# Task 3: Data Analysis                                           
 
# In the residential sector, natural gas is almost exclusively for space heating, cooking and water boilers. Residential gas demand therefore shows a strong seasonality and a dependence on cold weather.
 
# Attached are two data files: Temperatures Indiana.csv with daily average temperatures in degree Fahrenheit for Indiana from 09/01/2010 to 04/30/2015 and Residential Demand Indiana.csv with monthly residential gas demand for Indiana from September 2010 to December 2014.
 
# Based on these data, create a residential natural gas demand forecast for January-April 2015. You get extra credit if you can also provide us with an assessment of daily natural gas demand for each day during this period. Give an explanation of your methodology and a discussion of potential problems.
 
# Please use MatLab, R or any other statistical package to solve the problem and provide the documented code for your steps from data preparation to estimation and prediction. If you have difficulty reading the data files, you can change the format any way you like using excel.
